# PRODUCT MANAGEMENT APP - MY STORE
My store is a backend focused product management application for the admin which simply carried out CRUD operations.
Made with pure php. I first started making this in a generic manner stored in the 'Bad' folder. Then i made it into a manner where code parts are resuable and all codes aren't public and can't be navigated to(better). 
Lastly, I revamped it into an even better one which uses the Model-View-Controller (MVC) design, composers and a router making it a little bit more sophisticated.

The frontend was quickly whipped up with bootstrap
